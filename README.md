# Alarm-System-using-Python

The objective of our project is to implement an alarm clock using Python. Python consists of some very innovative libraries such as datetime and tkinter which help us to build the project using the current date and time as well as to provide a user interface to set the alarm according to the requirement in 24-hour format.

It’s also important to note that the alarm clock we’re building is a desktop application, which differs from the ones that work on web browsers. Online alarm clocks like this one run in web browsers and typically rely on JavaScript for their real-time functionality. While our Python project requires knowledge of GUI programming, creating a browser-based version would need web development skills instead.
